Dear Sir,
I would like to express my concern.
As Per the given requirements of Specification Topics the Minimum time require to complete is July 15 and maximum may extend till August.
Please find attached Detailed Genuine timeline File.

Minimum and maximum time is due to : Updating with True Specification, New Algorithm, Rigorous Testing:
As there is no Documentation and Flow Charts, which leads to adoption of test and trial process, which takes time.

As I care for quality of work and quality of work is proportional to Time. 
Sorry to say, but I do not accept any Unrealistic Deadline, Which may lead to Poor Time Management, Poor work, Low Quality Program,
buggy Program, Clients bugs problem, Trapping in bug Fixing, affects my performance and company performance as well.

Request to please consider Genuine timeline, to enable project delivery with high quality and performance.


Regards,
Pathan Muzafar Ali Khan
