Part 1 - General Requirments
part 2 - Reinforce Concrete Structure
part 3 - Prestressed Concrete Structure
part 4 - Design Table

MINIMUM REINFORCEMENT FOR WATER TANK
For 200mm Thick 0.3% area of concrete section
For 450mm Thick 0.2% area of Concrete section  

M 15 grade
floor slab is usually 150 to 200 mm 

M100 grade
Before laying the slab the bed has to be rammed and leveled then a 75 mm thick layer of lean concrete of M100 grade should be laid and cured

CIRCULAR WATER TANK 20000000 liters and with diameter in the range of 5 to 8 m.
