In so silent why ears genertes sound
Brain use sound cancellation technique to foucus on particular sounds
Brain generates default noise cancellatin pulse to cancel sound on noise what we hear
Even in Silence Brain genereates Noise calcellation pulse, but due to no inputs sound form exxternal in silence 
,than noise calcellations pulse processess and creates sound , even there is no sound !

Every person have different Noise calcellatioin brain pulse frequency and intensity as per sourrounding where they leave.

Equation
Input sound(convert in to pulse in Brain) + (-Brain Noise Pulse auto generates in brain) =(Processess)= We Listion Output as some sound(talk music) // General 
Input Nosound(no pulse in Brain)  + (-Brain Noise Pulse auto generates in brain(auto)) =(Processess)= We Hear Only NOise !
